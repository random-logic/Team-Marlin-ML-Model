## Problem we are trying to solve
Eating outside at restaurants is fun, especially as a night out with friends. However, this can be quite unhealthy, as we explore in the dataset. We aim to make an appliation that makes picking food from restaurants easy, while budgeting nutrient requirements and calories limits. Our goal is to recommend restaurant food to people by inputting their nutrient targets. How will we recommend these foods to people?
